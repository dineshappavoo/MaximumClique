MAXIMUM CLIQUE:

JOIN:

GRAPH ==> TAKE TWO MAXIMAL CLIQUE ==> BIPARTITE COMPLEMENT OF CLIQUES ==> INDEPENDENT SET ==> BICLIQUE IN GRAPH



INDEPENDENT SET:
VERTEX COVER ==> COMPLEMENT

MAXIMAL CLIQUE(Node, candidate_list, potential_list):
1. Start from node start_node
2. take the adjacency list of Node
3. for each node in adjacency list
        if start_node is adjacent of candidate_list nodes
